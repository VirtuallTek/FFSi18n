# Fighter Factory Studio Base Translation Sources
These files are used to translate Fighter Factory Studio to any language using Qt Linguist (https://download.qt.io/linguist_releases/).

# How to Translate
Open Qt Linguist, go to File / Open and select a .ts file. You will be prompted to select source and destination languages. Choose English as source and the language you're translating to as destination and confirm.
To know how to use the program follow the manual here: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-translators.html

# How to put it into Fighter Factory
Follow the en-us folder structure. Edit Info.xml and fill it with the language and your information.
Place all translated files in this folder and you're done (must be the .qm file produced by File / Release).
